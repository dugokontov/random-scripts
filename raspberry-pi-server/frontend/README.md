This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Development
When developing this application, start it using

```sh
yarn start
```

It will open port `3001`. Note that backend should be started as well (on port `3000`).

## Production

To create a production build run:

```sh
npm run build
```

All files are now built in `build` folder. To access application, use backend. Backend is designed to serve those static files from `/app` domain.
